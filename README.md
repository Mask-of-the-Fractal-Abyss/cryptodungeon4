Cryptodungeon is a game in which players explore a virtual dungeon, by unlocking rooms with unique keys. Every room has a code which is needed to unlock it. Anyone with the code for a room can access it, and build there. Cryptodungeon uses elements of a 'battle royale' game mode: as players race to accumulate resources and infrastructure while staying hidden from their opponents as long as possible. However, as players become stronger, they acquire tools that can be used to hunt down their enemies, and track them among the myriad of rooms. 

It bares some similarities to cryptocurrency/blockchain because finding rooms represents computational work. 

Another significant theme of the game is the acquisition of procedurally generated knowledge. There are items and spells in the game, but you must discover their recipes and verses in order to cast or craft them. Then you can also build machines which automatically produce those resources.
